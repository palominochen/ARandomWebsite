    Hello, young warrior. Keep your claws sharp! I am Oceanstar, leader of OceanClan. Hmm? I assume you don't have any proper warrior training? Let's get you started. If you don't like the life of a warrior you can always be a loner, rogue or- StarClan forbid! -a kittypet. Since you look quite young, you should start to be a kit, and play with the others.
    <br><br>
    These are all, ALL the members of the Clan.
    <br><br>
    Me, Pathstep, Vinetuft, Blizzardshade, Runningwater, Beachflower, Mistyheart, Amberstone, Talonswipe, Hawkcloud,  Violetpaw, Lightningshadow, Darkmoon, Shadowpelt, Lightfall, Raykit, Lightkit, Tinyheart, Shoreflight, Rainstorm, Pebblekit, Stormkit, Wavepool, Darkfeather, Leopardwing, Tigerblaze, Snowpaw, Goldenpaw, Fishtail, Reedshine, Blizzardshade, Feathersong, Thornshade, Brownfoot, Spottedblaze, Hearttuft, Combkit, Spiderpaw, Ghostpaw, Silkkit, Firekit, Riverkit, Rainpool, Beachmoon, Gingerpelt, Swiftear, Shadekit, Mothkit, Sandkit, Sunkit, Darkkit, Mistkit, Nightpelt, Torrentail, Dolphinkit, Weakwave, Glacierpelt, Honeypool(unfortunately she's dead, but she's amazing. So we let her in here), and Widepool! I know it seems like a large amount, but soon if you join us, you will learn every cat, their strengths, weaknesses, kin, and friends. Again, if you feel like you're daunted at all, there are many ways to live. In the mountains, there is a group of cats who call themselves The Tribe of Rushing Water, better known as the Tribe. There are also three other Clans; BlazingClan, CloudClan, and GrassClan. I will be blocking your entryway to BlazingClan, as they are best known for being vicious and evil. I'll let you learn from Goldenpaw first.
    <br><br><br>
    Hello, my name is Goldenpaw. This is our camp. We prey on forest prey, rabbits and fish! Rarely we eat frogs or lizards, but it's only if we are starving. Yuck! I am glad we don't eat those very often, or else I'd be vomiting and I won't be able to eat! Anyways, the heap of moss and rocks are our dens. The nursery is the largest, left of it is the apprentice den, right of it is the medicine den. Left of the apprentice den is the elders' den. The moss is the warrior den, the at the bottom of the sand thing is the leader's den. Sometimes the leader sleeps with her mate. The sand is the Sandhill, where Oceanstar makes important announcements. You noticed we are tied to each other like littermates and parents, right? That's where the tree left of the dens becomes useful. It has the freshkill pile - do you see? All cats of OceanClan eat there. Snowpaw will explain the warrior code for you.
    <br><br><br>
    1. Defend your Clan, even with your life. You may have friendships with cats from other Clans, but your loyalty must remain with your Clan.<br>
    2. Do not hunt or trespass on another Clan's territory.<br>
    3. Elders, queens, and kits must be fed before apprentices and warriors. Unless they have permission, apprentices may not eat until they have hunted to feed the elders.<br>
    4. Prey is killed only to be eaten. Give thanks to StarClan for its life.<br>
    5. A kit must be at least six moons old to become an apprentice.<br>
    6. Newly appointed warriors will keep a silent vigil for one night after recieving their warrior name.<br>
    7. A cat cannot be made deputy without having mentored at least one apprentice.<br>
    8. The deputy will become Clan leader when the leader dies, retires, or is exiled.<br>
    9. After the death or retirement of the old deputy, the new deputy must be chosen before moonhigh.<br>
    10. A Gathering of all four Clans is held at the full moon during a truce that lasts for the night. There shall be no fighting among the Clans at this time.<br>
    11. Boundaries must be checked and marked daily. Challenge all trespassing cats.<br>
    12. No warrior can neglect a kit in pain or danger, even if it is from a different Clan.
  <br>
    13. The word of the Clan leader is the Warrior Code.<br>
    14. An honorable warrior does not need to kill other cats to win his/her battles, unless they are outside the warrior code or it is necessary for self-defense.<br>
    15. A warrior rejects the soft life of a kittypet.<br>
    16. In times of peace, the Clans stand alone, hunt alone, fight with one another over our boundaries. In times of trouble, Clan borders are meaningless and the Clans should help each other. 
    <br>17. There shall be no wars among the Clans unless it decides the Clans' fate.
    <br> Does it seem like plenty of rules? It may look like we are not free, but you're completely incorrect if you think so. We can break rules only if we think we are right. Break the code, like eating while hunting, will give you less severe punishments. It'll give you a moon of tick duty for an apprentice or a kit, or having to do apprentice duties and sleep in their den for a moon, if you are a warrior. If you betray the Clan, like murder a Clanmate, that will probably get you into exile unless the leader is also evil, more like Blazingstar!<br>
    I suppose you should learn about the other Clans now. First, we will show you BlazingClan! Don't worry, your guide will be friendly. Lightningflame?
    <br> Hi, I'm Lightningflame. This is our camp. The toughest warriors sleep at the highest cave of one of the mountains. The weaker ones sleep at the lower and worse cave. Blazingstar says the weak ones waste our prey. He doesn't kill all of them, just the elders. He, like all cats, doesn't kill kits. He's smart enough to know if there are no kits, we slowly die. Anyways, head off. I have to act like I'm chasing you. Get lost, kittypet! Also go to GrassClan next!<br>
    Hi, I'm Grasstar. Welcome to GrassClan. We live in the open grasslands and sleep there, closest to our ancestors. That's all. Just go to CloudClan. And don't tell anyone about GrassClan.<br>
    I'm Whiteclaw. Medicine cat of CloudClan. We live in the tree, which gives us our name. Weaker cats who can't climb have this den at the trunk. We eat prey there. When we are starving, we invade Twoleg farms for pheasants. Believe me, they're REALLY good.<br>
    I'm Oceanstar. Nice to meet again. Now, you can sign up!<br>
